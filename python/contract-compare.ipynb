    "# Answer:\n",
    "# Both contracts contain provisions regarding record dates for various events related to the American Depositary Shares (ADS) and the underlying Deposited Securities. The similarities include:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. The Depositary has the authority to fix a record date for various events, such as dividend or distribution payments, the issuance of rights, the determination of voting rights, and changes to the number of Shares represented by each ADS.\n",
    "# 2. The owners of Receipts (holders of ADS) are entitled to receive dividends, distributions, or net proceeds of sales based on the number of ADS they own on the record date.\n",
    "# 3. The owners are responsible for any fees assessed by the Depositary on or after the record date.\n",
    "# 4. The provisions regarding record dates are subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The differences are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. The first contract refers to the record date for the determination of the owners of Shares or other Deposited Securities, while the second contract mentions the record date for the owners of Receipts.\n",
    "# 2. The first contract states that the owners on the record date are entitled to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights, while the second contract does not explicitly mention this.\n",
    "# 3. The first contract states that the Receipts must be executed and delivered, and countersigned by a duly authorized officer of the Registrar, while the second contract does not have this requirement.\n",
    "# 4. The first contract does not mention the termination of the Deposit Agreement, while the second contract includes provisions for termination.\n",
